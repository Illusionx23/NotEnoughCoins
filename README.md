**NotEnoughCoins**

A SkyBlock Flipping Mod.

Some people requested me to publish the mod on github, so I did!


    /nec - Shows the config GUI
    /nec help - Shows the help message containing all the subcommands and their usage
    /nec toggle - Enables the mod to return a list of suggested items to flip whenever one is found.
    /nec minpercent <amount> - Set the minimum percentage profit for a flip.!
    /nec speed <speed> - Select the number of async threads you want the flipper to use.
    /nec alertsound - Toggle pings for flips.
    
We are not liable for any coins you lost by buying items without checking, flips aren't always perfect

Guide on how to make it work: Download forge 1.8.9 modloader (or basically any modloader), then you may want to put this mod in the mod folder. Then, select the forge 1.8.9 profile in the minecraft launcher, and hit play. Type /nec in the chat to config up the mod.
